<h1>Hi, I'm Aishwarya! <br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aishwarya-chennabathni/">Data Scientist</a></h1>

<h2>👨‍💻 Introduction:</h2>

I’m a Data Scientist with 6+ years of experience delivering end-to-end AI/ML and GenAI solutions across healthcare, logistics, insurance, real estate, and the public sector. I build production systems—from forecasting and pricing to RAG assistants and document intelligence—grounded in strong MLOps, measurable impact, and clear communication with business leaders.&#x20;

**💡 What I Do:**

* **GenAI & NLP**: RAG apps (LangChain, Llamaindex, FAISS), GPT-4–powered assistants, semantic search, summarization, NER, OCR + entity extraction.
* **Forecasting & optimization**: SARIMA/Prophet/LSTM for demand, inventory, and capacity; elasticity modeling and causal A/B testing for pricing.
* **Predictive ML**: XGBoost/LightGBM/Scikit-learn pipelines for churn, risk, and classification with SHAP/LIME for explainability.
* **Analytics to action**: translate insights into workflows and dashboards; lead Agile sprints, reviews, and stakeholder readouts.

**⚙ Tech Stack:**

* **Languages:** Python, SQL
* **ML/DL:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, LightGBM, Hugging Face, Statsmodels
* **Data & Orchestration:** Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, Spark/PySpark, dbt, Airflow
* **MLOps & Cloud:** MLflow, Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD; AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, GCP Vertex AI
* **GenAI/RAG:** GPT-4, LangChain, FAISS, Prompt Engineering; governance with SHAP/LIME and compliance (FOIP/HIA/GDPR)

**📈 Recent Highlights:**

* Shipped a secure GPT-4 virtual assistant for Ontario’s Ministry of Health (RAG over policy + Snowflake), cutting inquiry resolution time by 60% and improving accessibility.
* Built multi-seasonal LTC bed-demand forecasting (SARIMA) with drift diagnostics and MLflow tracking, embedded in operational dashboards.
* Delivered churn prediction and pricing optimization for logistics, improving early churn detection and informing revenue-positive pricing moves.

**🔎 Interests:**
Responsible AI, LLMOps (prompt versioning, drift monitoring), retrieval quality, and turning analytical models into reliable, user-centric products.
