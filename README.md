<h1>Hi, I'm Aishwarya! <br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aishwarya-chennabathni/">Data Scientist</a></h1>

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Introduction:</h2>

I‚Äôm a Data Scientist with 6+ years of experience delivering end-to-end AI/ML and GenAI solutions across healthcare, logistics, insurance, real estate, and the public sector. I build production systems‚Äîfrom forecasting and pricing to RAG assistants and document intelligence‚Äîgrounded in strong MLOps, measurable impact, and clear communication with business leaders.&#x20;

**üí° What I Do:**

* Forecasting & optimization: SARIMA/Prophet/LSTM for demand, inventory, and capacity; elasticity modeling and causal A/B testing for pricing.
* Predictive ML: XGBoost/LightGBM/Scikit-learn pipelines for churn, risk, and classification with SHAP/LIME for explainability.
* GenAI & NLP: RAG apps (LangChain, FAISS), GPT-4‚Äìpowered assistants, semantic search, summarization, NER, OCR + entity extraction.
* Analytics to action: translate insights into workflows and dashboards; lead Agile sprints, reviews, and stakeholder readouts.

**‚öô Tech Stack:**

* **Languages:** Python, SQL
* **ML/DL:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, LightGBM, Hugging Face, Statsmodels
* **Data & Orchestration:** Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, Spark/PySpark, dbt, Airflow
* **MLOps & Cloud:** MLflow, Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD; AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, GCP Vertex AI
* **GenAI/RAG:** GPT-4, LangChain, FAISS, Prompt Engineering; governance with SHAP/LIME and compliance (FOIP/HIA/GDPR)

**üìà Recent Highlights:**

* Shipped a secure GPT-4 virtual assistant for Ontario‚Äôs Ministry of Health (RAG over policy + Snowflake), cutting inquiry resolution time by 60% and improving accessibility.
* Built multi-seasonal LTC bed-demand forecasting (SARIMA) with drift diagnostics and MLflow tracking, embedded in operational dashboards.
* Delivered churn prediction and pricing optimization for logistics, improving early churn detection and informing revenue-positive pricing moves.

**üîé Interests:**
Responsible AI, LLMOps (prompt versioning, drift monitoring), retrieval quality, and turning analytical models into reliable, user-centric products.
